 1. Android Apps (trying to reproduce Netflix, creating an android app for Libgen, combing through Google's books on android development) 
 
  - Netflix => One of my main goals in re-developing Netflix as an app, is to learn as much as I can of Android development, and Android in general. 
  - Libgen => It's definitely a passion of mine, but Libgen's mission really strikes me as being very powerful; spreading knowledge, no matter who you are and where you are... That is why I'm fixated on developing an Android app and help others use it.
  
  - Google Documentation => Although it's not a personal project or anything, I think there's certainly something to be said of discipline in learning, and the drive to learn continuously, not just when required of you. The obsession to learn, from where I stand, or sit, seems like one of the ultimate drivers of successful mastery; and I focus on that drive and discipline every day, to excel in whatever I aim to do.

3. Spending time on e-ink technology.
- I have a DPT-CP1 (Sony Digital Paper e-ink reader) and I paid an extreme price for it; I don't regret it one moment. E-ink really stunned me as something that's so capable of providing an experience of joy and happiness through reading. Although there's lag between page turns, it doesn't take too much off of the experience in my books. I also love that it is large enough to support textbooks, where traditional e-readers, about 6 inches perhaps, would require superhuman sight to use textbooks on them. 

- The technology, the technology. I haven't read too much into it, but the implementation of it seems pretty cool. So far as I know, they have both black and white particles, where they can utilize electricity to charge them and bring either black or white to the top of the screen, or even a hybrid (combination of some white, combination of some black) Through millions of these "charges," you can display a full page of content.
